# Deep Vision and Graphics

This repo supplements course "Deep Vision and Graphics" taught at YSDA @fall'21.
The course is the successor of ["Deep Learning"](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/tree/spring21/) course taught at YSDA in 2015-2021. New course focuses more on applications of deep learning for computer vision.

Lecture and seminar materials for each week are in ./week* folders. Homeworks are in ./homework* folders.
